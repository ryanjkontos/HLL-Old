# How Long Left
How Long Left is a macOS menu bar app written in Swift that counts down how long left until the end of the current calendar event.

## Why does this Exist?
I pretty much just created this because I'm a student, and while sitting in class I frequently find myself checking the time to see how long I have left. How Long Left lets me be lazy and not have to work the time remaining out in my head, while I'm already being lazy in class.
